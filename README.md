DigiFrame

Laguage: Java

IDE: Processing 1.5.1

Description:

This project enables its users to display pitcures in the 'data' folder using a marker ('marker complete.jpg') and their webcam on the screen. The projecct uses marker based augmented reality to achieve this. 

There are 5 markers that need to be viewable to the webcam in order to dislpay images. They are:

- DG
- next
- prev
- minus (zout)
- plus (zin)

Images are displayd over the DG marker, and hiding the appropriate marker controls the appropriate action of the frame. For e.g., if you hide next, next image is displayed, if you hide plus, image is zoomed in, and so on.

Running Instructions:

The libraries provided need to be installed in the 'libraries' folder in the 'sketchbook' folder of processing. DigiFrame.pde file needs to be compiled from the IDE to be able to run the code.
